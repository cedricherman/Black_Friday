    "As opposed to Random Forest, GBRT does `'best'` split for each node of each tree. `'best'` finds the optimal feature and threshold for each new node. However, we have control over the sample size (number of training instances to include at each new tree) which will add randomness to this sequential process (see '`subsample`')\n",

    "1. **`n_estimators`**, number of sequential trees, should be higher if learning rate low (generally tuned by cv)\n",
